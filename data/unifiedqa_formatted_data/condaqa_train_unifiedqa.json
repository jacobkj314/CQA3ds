Most criminal and civil cases originate in the Courts of Common Pleas, which also serve as appellate courts to the district judges and for local agency decisions. The Superior Court hears all appeals from the Courts of Common Pleas not expressly designated to the Commonwealth Court or Supreme Court. It also has original jurisdiction to review warrants for wiretap surveillance.

At high temperatures, organobromine compounds readily dissociate to yield free bromine atoms, a process that stops free radical chemical chain reactions. This effect makes organobromine compounds useful as fire retardants, and more than half the bromine produced worldwide each year is put to this purpose. The same property causes ultraviolet sunlight to dissociate volatile organobromine compounds in the atmosphere to yield free bromine atoms, causing ozone depletion. As a result, many organobromine compounds are no longer used with the exception of the pesticide methyl bromide. Bromine compounds are still used in well drilling fluids, in photographic film, and as an intermediate in the manufacture of organic chemicals."], "answer": ["YES", "NO", "NO", "YES", "DON'T KNOW", "YES"]}

The original MDMA synthesis described in Merck's patent involves brominating safrole to 1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-bromopropane and then reacting this adduct with methylamine. Most illicit MDMA is synthesized using MDP2P (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone) as a precursor. MDP2P in turn is generally synthesized from piperonal, safrole or isosafrole. One method is to isomerize safrole to isosafrole in the presence of a strong base, and then oxidize isosafrole to MDP2P. Another method uses the Wacker process to oxidize safrole directly to the MDP2P intermediate with a palladium catalyst. Once the MDP2P intermediate has been prepared, a reductive amination leads to racemic MDMA (an equal parts mixture of (\"R\")-MDMA and (\"S\")-MDMA). Relatively small quantities of essential oil are required to make large amounts of MDMA. The essential oil of \"Ocotea cymbarum\", for example, typically contains between 80 and 94% safrole.

Ultimately Neil was replaced by John Corabi (formerly of Angora and the Scream), but the band decided to bring Neil back when Corabi didn't work out. Although M\u00f6tley's self-titled March 1994 release made the \"Billboard\" top ten (#7), the album was a commercial failure. It also prompted negative reactions from many fans due to Neil trying out a new sound on the album. Corabi had suggested that the band bring back Neil, believing the latter would always be seen as the voice of the band. This resulted in his own firing in 1993. Corabi spoke about his time with the band and his thoughts on the first failed record by M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. Corabi said: \"that record was the first record that they had done that didn't go platinum, didn't make some sort of crazy noise, and everybody panicked\".

Does the passage suggest that this was the case even in the desert campaigns of North Africa, so that even heavy tank assaults found themselves vulnerable to lighter, faster forces?\nRolf-Dieter M\u00fcller comments that the war in North Africa, while as bloody as any other war, differed considerable from the war of annihilation in eastern Europe, because it was limited to a narrow coastline and hardly affected the population. Showalter writes that: \"From the desert campaign\u2019s beginning, both sides consciously sought to wage a \"clean\" war\u2014war without hate, as Rommel put it in his reflections. Explanations include the absence of civilians and the relative absence of Nazis; the nature of the environment, which conveyed a \"moral simplicity and transparency\"; and the control of command on both sides by prewar professionals, producing a British tendency to depict war in the imagery of a game, and the corresponding German pattern of seeing it as a test of skill and a proof of virtue. The nature of the fighting as well diminished the last-ditch, close-quarter actions that are primary nurturers of mutual bitterness. A battalion overrun by tanks usually had its resistance broken, but if lighter units can scatter and regroup, there is usually nothing that the enemy can do to prevent a counter-attack from behind the line."], "answer": ["NO", "YES", "YES", "NO", "NO", "YES"]}

Computer programmers no longer need to worry about where their data is physically stored or whether the user's computer will have enough memory. It also allows multiple types of memory to be used. For example, some data can be stored in physical RAM chips while other data is stored on a hard drive (e.g. in a swapfile), functioning as an extension of the cache hierarchy. This drastically increases the amount of memory available to programs. The operating system will place actively used data in physical RAM, which is much faster than hard disks. When the amount of RAM is not sufficient to run all the current programs, it can result in a situation where the computer spends more time moving data from RAM to disk and back than it does accomplishing tasks; this is known as thrashing."], "answer": ["NO", "YES", "NO", "YES", "DON'T KNOW"]}

{"input": ["If someone were making an analogy between airplane flights and the relationship between adrenaline and AC, would they describe it as a direct flight?\nThese adenylyl cyclases are the most familiar based on extensive study due to their important roles in human health. They are also found in some bacteria, notably \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\" where they appear to have a key role in pathogenesis. Most AC-III's are integral membrane proteins involved in transducing extracellular signals into intracellular responses. A Nobel Prize was awarded to Earl Sutherland in 1971 for discovering the key role of AC-III in human liver, where adrenaline indirectly stimulates AC to mobilize stored energy in the \"fight or flight\" response. The effect of adrenaline is via a G protein signaling cascade, which transmits chemical signals from outside the cell across the membrane to the inside of the cell (cytoplasm).

During Europe's major pre-revolutionary war, the Seven Years' War of 1756\u20131763, few armies ever numbered more than 200,000 with field forces often numbering less than 30,000. The French innovations of separate corps (allowing a single commander to efficiently command more than the traditional command span of 30,000 men) and living off the land (which allowed field armies to deploy more men without requiring an equal increase in supply arrangements such as depots and supply trains) allowed the French republic to field much larger armies than their opponents.
